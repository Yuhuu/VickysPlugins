React works with Virtual DOM, state change, compute Diff, 

The reconciliation process is where React

Compares the previous internal instance with the next internal instance.
Updates the internal Instance which is a Component Tree structure in JavaScript Object(Virtual DOM).
And updates the actual DOM only at the node where there is an actual change along with it’s children.

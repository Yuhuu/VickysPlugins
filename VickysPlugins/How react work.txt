If angular extended javascrip and Html.

React works with Virtual DOM, state change, compute Diff, 

The reconciliation process is where React

Compares the previous internal instance with the next internal instance.
Updates the internal Instance which is a Component Tree structure in JavaScript Object(Virtual DOM).
And updates the actual DOM only at the node where there is an actual change along with itâ€™s children.

ES2015 const
Conact(),  cause push() mutate the original arry, so it is not FP ready:
example. 
const a = [1,2]

const c = [...a,3] so that const c = [1,2,3]


State is like a data store to the ReactJS component. It is mostly used to update the component when user performed some action like clicking button, typing some text, pressing some key, etc.


Pure function, passing the same parameters always result in the same output
during its executionm a pure duncton does not change anything outside of it.
pure function never changes any of the parameters that get passed to it by reference. (in js, object and array)

Data transfermation: data is changed by creating copy
Array.reduce() transfer  that arry on anything else, like a  boolean, an object.

Fibonacci sequence calculation.

Var vs let as valirable in block.
logical &&, while loops. for loops.
console.log 
String escape sequences. State is important. Destructuring i s a convenient way of extracting multiple values from data stored in  nested objects of array.
Destructing objects. Do not modify your state
Object.assgin

Todo: homework:
